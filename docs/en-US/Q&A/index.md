## Game Crashes/Freezes

If you are using an older version of the mod, please update to the latest version and try again.

## When will it be updated to 1.20+?

There are still a few important features pending implementation; the update will be released once they are completed.

## When will it be ported to older versions (1.18, 1.16, 1.12)?

I plan to update to the latest version before contemplating porting to older versions.

## Unable to auto-aim with a specific item

If the item is not from the vanilla Minecraft, you can manually add configurations or create a resource pack yourself. You can also reach out to the authors of related mods and request them to incorporate the necessary resources in the new version.
