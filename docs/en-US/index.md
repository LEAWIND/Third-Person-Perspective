This is a client-side mod.

This documentation is only applicable to version 2.0.7 and above.

## Features

Toggle between first-person and third-person perspectives by pressing F5.

### Shoot enemies with precision like first person

When aiming at a distant enemy in third person, this mod will automatically predict the target entity you want to shoot. You only need to put the crosshair above the enemy just like in first person.

### Precise Adjustment of Camera Offset with the Mouse

Hold Z, and moving the mouse can adjust the camera offset (player's position on the screen), while using the mouse wheel can adjust the camera's distance from the player.

### Quickly Switch Camera Offset Position: Left | Center | Right

Short press CapsLock to switch between left and right; hold CapsLock to switch to the center.

### Automatically Enter Aim Mode

Under specific conditions, aim mode can be activated. Aim mode uses different camera offset values compared to normal mode, and they can be adjusted separately.

It automatically enters aim mode based on the player holding certain items. For example, in the default configuration, aiming with a bow, trident, or holding a charged crossbow, ender pearls, etc., will automatically trigger aim mode. You can change these rules in the configuration.

### Player Transparency

When the camera is close to the player or the crosshair is pointed at the player, the player becomes semi-transparent.

::: warning
If you have Optifine installed, please disable the following option; otherwise, rotating the viewpoint in third person may not be smooth.
