# Leawind's Third Person

A practical, smooth, feature-rich third person mod for all Minecraft players.

* **Precision Shooting:** Aim at distant enemies in third-person, and the mod intelligently predicts the target entity. Simply put your crosshair above the target, similar to first-person.

* **Smart Aim Mode:** Automatically enters aiming mode based on held items, such as bows, tridents, or loaded crossbows. Rules are customizable to suit other mods.

* **Smooth Perspective Switching:** Press F5 to smoothly transition between first-person and third-person views.

* **Camera Adjustment:** Hold Z and use the mouse to move or scroll to adjust the camera's position.

* **Quick Perspective Shifts:** Short press of CapsLock for left or right shifts, long press for centering.

* **Player Transparency:** Player entity becomes semi-transparent when the camera is close or the crosshair is aimed at the player.

* **Toggle mod enable/disable：** Key binding is also available.
